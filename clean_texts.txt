Alright cool cause that would be a terrible waste
Yeah
Agreed
Do you mind if I have a small slice of the Parmesan?
Nope. Go for it
Thanks to you and thanks to humble cheese makers across the globe who make the lives of poor college students like us a little easier every day

Oh well I just talked to him and he's busy at 12:30 so he said to at 2
He sent an email
Ok
Hey I slept in, can you grab the lecture notes and checkpoints?

Podium
Hey could you ask your parents if they could give me a ride to the airport around 5pm
?
Tomorrow
Ill ask
Don't lock the door. I left my keys in the room
Wanna do physics?
Where are you?
Come play QuizUp with me! https://www.quizup.com
Yo what's the answer?

When are you coming back?
You not asleep!!
Nope I'm out and about
Hey can you leave the door open, I forgot my key
Ok
Dude I just woke up and puked and still feel like shit, I'm skipping Physics today, grab me the lecture notes
Ok
Where are you?
3rd floor physics. Common room
Come up for last Chem studying
u getting lunch?
I'm in Nord
where the test will be?
Oops, I read ford. I'm there. Freudian slip
Frat party?
Nah I'm watching Oceans 11 on the first floor
a great movie
Yeah it's one of my favorites
Food is here
Almost done
Do u know what the average was on chem?
No clue
Oh well. How are u doing?
Fine, I'm on the train back now, it gets into Cleveland around 3:30am
A reasonable hour
Yup, I'll get there just in time to change for rowing practice
It's perfect timing
Wow
Yeah, but I'm just glad I got a ride back with leg room that wasn't too too expensive
That's good
Hey can you check the area for my keys?
It's attached to a USB drive
I'm already back at wade
Shit
Went back, found them
Yay
Well shit.
Didn't go well?
http://Animehaven.org/episodes/western-cartoons/avatar-the-last-airbender
Where are you?
In the marathon
Come here, I'll give u my key
Nah I went to Wade, I got in
Ok
When r u heading over?
Heading over where?
Marathon
Where is it?
Strosacker
What's on right now?
Forbidden planet
It just ended
Alright I have to wait here for a bit
Next is a surprise film
But I'll be there as soon as I can
I'll be gone for around an hour at 1pm at a meeting, but I'll be back after that
Alright, if you but a pass can you come and go all you want
*buy
I have a pass. U should see how many movies u want to see and see whether it's worth the price
Is that online or do I have to come to strosacker?
At Strosacker is where u buy. Can check movie schedule online
Google case western sci fi marathon
Second link
Hmm I really want to see Jumanji but the rest are iffy
Click the text "40th marathon" and scroll down
Plus there's Skyzone
Edge of tomorrow is great
Which would take up a few hours
I can't do skyzlne. I haven't slept a wink
Haha alright well I'll let you know when I get there
Cool
Where does Ryan mean? "1 in tink in the big room in the tail of the building over closest to the hill"
1pm in Tink in one of the conference rooms on the far side of the building
I think
I don't know what room exactly that he's talking about though
The one looking at the steps up to the long hill
Maybe
You can find it when you get there
Thanks
Come
At this point it's not worth the money, especially considering I can't stay for long
Pay for a couple individual movies
Only 4$ a movie. Incredibly cheap
Alright I'll try to stop by
Sweet
Come now and you won't even miss part of a movie
I'm busy though
What are you so busy with on a Saturday
...xcom
Oh cummon. U can do that anytime. This is only annual
It's just movies and they're not even very good
I could be using that money on food!
Or xcom expansions!
That's part of the point that not all of them are good. It's only 8 bucks
For 2 movies
Whelp skyzone's in an hour so maybe after that
Ok :(
Do you have the key?
Why did you lock the door?
I have no key
Sorry. I forgot. I was going to a Cavs game so I locked up
I moved the party to 9 so everyone could come
Ok
What did you want me to pick up at the store again?
Crackers and sliced bread
Will do
Hey, when do you get back?
10 mins?
Alright, cool I don't have my key so I'm chilling in the common room
starboard is on sale right now
starbound
Alright I'll buy it but you have to help me finish the last two physics problems
come to thwing right now
Haha alright I just need to finish lunch
ok.
Hey I'm at thawing
*thwing
You have a few tiny mistakes in problem 4
Like variables that shouldn't be there
How?
Send a picture. Don't write on my paper
What variables?
You don't cancel out r when you add cos theta
At the start
I do. I convert r into sqrt(z^2 + x^2)
Read the top line
No that's cos theta
Nope.
Oh I see
Okay that works
Yup
I still don't understand why you can just multiply by theta at the start
To get the right magnitude
Yeah but that's Erodx not Erodtotal
Like it's a component of the electric field
The x components cancel. Only the z is left
So that's what the z hats for
Yes. The direction
Yeah I guess that works
But it's a big step for the first thing you write down
Can u draw lines from my top line of r and cos to show how I feed them in
Alright I did it in pencil
Thx
Did u turn it in?
Yup
Thx
When do you get back?
3:30
At the latest
Y?
I'm in the common room but I have no key
I'll just stop by Wade
I have a package anyway
I didn't lock it did I?
Yup
No worries though
Sorry
How'd last night go?
That's Quinn's hat
So very well?
*!
;)
Liana?
Yeah made out, brought her back, made out some more, got almost naked but she didn't want to have sex or do anything so we just had intense makeout sessions while "watching" Good Will Hunting
Not bad
The awkward part is that Quinn kept calling her and drunkenly banged on the door a few times asking if I wanted to hang out
He was really drunk
That is awkward
Yeah I don't know if he knew she was there but it was kinda scary
The funny part is that I have her giant hickeys on both sides of her neck
U rascal
ðŸ˜‰
Anyway it was a fun night, the Yule ball wasn't terrible
U at an si session?
Eating
I get why anti bonding orbitals are less stable now
Cool. Explain later
What's the document you found with the physics answers
I don't remember, it's in my history but I'm leaving right now
Did u fridge?
Everything but the bagels
K
Should I throw this away?
Wait
Alright I'll leave it for you but I'm opening up a new package


Need room
Ok
Clean up food
Room still occupied?
Nope
physics meeting at 12:40
Physics meeting
I'm here
Kk
I'm going to bed, so I'll be asleep when u get back
Aight leave the door unlocked
K
Can I give a bit of your cheese to Liana in exchange for tea, a bit of food and possibly a blowjob?
Better be enough food for me for breakfast tomorrow. A mans gotta eat
Don't worry, I'm at Leutner right now with Tupperware in hand so I'll grab what I can
Ok
Leave my math notebook and red math binder in the hall please
If it comes to that I will
K
Ya done?
All good
Dude, I'm not feeling great, not coming to class. I'll try to get to the meeting if I can though
Ok
Still feel bad, can't come to meeting
Ok. Feel better
Jolly!
Where are you guys?
Phil!! Respond to David
Let me know when you get here
Late tonight
Alright, I'll find a way to get into the room
I think I just butt dialed you
Sorry
Aok. I guessed that when all I heard was fuzzy noises
What rotted and died in our room? It smells awful
It's from Florida, I can't locate the source though
The general Floridian smell?
No, mostly unwashed and sweaty clothes from a week of rowing
that'd do it.
Wait. You didn't studiously take time off of partying to do laundry? Tsk
Don't worry, it was only a little break
Can you grab another thing of bread if you're still there
Sorry I'm already at Rockefeller, I'll try to at dinner
Ok
Hey did you lock the door?
I don't remember
When do you get back?
In around half an hour
Sorry. Not for another hour and 15
Let me know when you get back

Door is open
Aight cool

That sounds good
Coming
Hey babe;) Claire's here
Did you head back home?
Is la barberia good?
7 bucks
How badly will they fuck up?
Not much
Well it may be terrible but it's gotta happen eventually
He's not yet at his office
I think I left my charger in the physics lab.
Do you know where?
Front right
White laptop charger?
Yup
Okay I'll be bringing it back for the low low price of 19.99 (plus shipping and handling)
Thanks
P.S. Shipping and handling is $99.98
Also I consolidated and uploaded most of our files to Ruhl's repository
I put all non function code into one main file
Just FYI
I'm going to be in KSL
That's weird
I'll stop by
I'm at KSL
Coming
Where r u?
I thought you were on your way
I'm there
Can u send me a pick of problem #4. I think I number crunched the last part wrong
The next problem
My bad
Can you change the R to greater than 4.1874 * 10^(-6)
And write that "I" is then less than 5.095 Amps
Alright I'll change it
Thanks. That should be correct then
Hey can you tap n go Dennys since you're not using your swipes?
Do u still want me to do it? Your text just got through
Yeah that'd be sweet
What do u want?
There's only one option
Grand slam
Done
Thanks man, I hope you didn't miss out on any Canadian tapingo action
I checked. There isn't any in Toronto
Those kanuks don't know what they're missing out on
I was lonely and thinking "if Nathaniel was here he'd go into elaborate detail about the fancy, expensive, ridiculously lavish dinner he just had or was about to have" and then you sent that and I stopped feeling so lonely
So thanks for that
youâ€™re welcome. I am stuffed like one of those cooked pigs with an apple in its mouth
Hey do you have another Tapingo?
No
Are you living in the house this week?
Wanna go to a Cavs game next Monday night?
Tickets are free
Yes, and hell fucking yes
Sorry I didn't mention it but my phone died
out of battery died, or dead dead
Battery died
It still works as of now
obviamente. I didnâ€™t know if you had to get a new phone. That would be unfortunate.
Hey, i have a great idea.
get a charger ðŸ˜Š
I could but your charger is just so fast and cuddly
trying to steal her away from me. I wonâ€™t stand for it
I can't help it if she wants to charge me
I guess I'm just too chargeable ðŸ˜‰
you realize itâ€™s a male port output?
What!?
I mean....Pshh yeah I knew that
it only fits in female ports
I never actually charged with it
I ain't no female port
are you against a loving gay relationship?
Tis a modern age
I accept your charging habits
There's nothing wrong with male on male ports!
It's just not my thing
Now if you'll excuse me...I have to unplug something
ha. c u round
btw. Whys exam next monday
phys
Hey since you were gone this weekend, physics research tonight?
Research?
When?
Sure
Soon
Hey did you lock the door to the room?
Nope
Alright just checkin before I head over
Are we meeting with Ruhl today?
I assume so
Ok
You got some mail
When do you move back in? I'll need to not lock the door that day
I move back Sunday
Also could I use your physics book?
Locked in my room
U could get a key from wade to unlock the room
Alright, I'll use that as a last resort
K
Are we meeting Ruhl today?
Yes
Do u get free cupcakes for manning the booth?
If there are leftovers
Which there were today

Let me know when you get this
I really just need space for the futon, rugs and table
Let me know when you get this
Unless you stayed up all night playing civ in which case I'll be long gone
But actually though, if you see this I'll be at my final which I come back from at around 3:30 and the futon, table and rugs will be in the room with nowhere to go so I'll help you pack that up before I have to go
I just woke up. I don't have a car until tonight. Good luck on the final!
Hey dude I need to ask one more big favor of you
I've got everything setup except for the futon
It's at Phi Kapp House now. Could you come by some time to pick it up? I'm sure the brothers will help you
Ok. Sure. Have a great regatta. Did the test go fine?
Yeah it was easy as pie, probably the second easiest one I've taken
Also thanks a million man, I really appreciate it
No prob.

There's not much going on here, I'd say Sparty if you're going out
Just confirming, u're coming tomorrow night?
I dont think so
Ive got a lot of work and I'm gonna be busy straight until 5 with other stuff so I need the night
:(
:(
But good food and come on
We'll see but probably not
:(
You can do it
Hey could I use your printer to print out my lab scope picture?
Sure. B and w
Got it
Do you have any paper for it?
Top drawer
I have your backpack
Are you bringing it to Physics
?
Yes
Thanks
?
What was the 5$ for?
Remember the 5 dollars in ones you gave me on Friday?
Oh yeah
If not I'll take it back
Thx
Dang it
No prob
Are you around?
In physics
Common room
Come over
The lounge?
Yeah
Play. When should we walk over?
Daves?
Yeah once I get back from Fribley
Let's go to Daves
Let's go to Daves
What time will u be back?
I'll be back in 40
I'm on my way from South side now
*north side
It's alright. I already went
what is the less difficult Discrete called?
Theres EECS 302 and MATH 304
302 is less in depth
damn it. I canâ€™t do an EECS. Has to be Math department
Do u have a schematic of the 555 timer?
Isn't there one on the computer?
We are supposed to design one right?
Oops. It says "based" not build
Not cheese :(
U left your card in the dorm
Hey do you mind sending me your answers to the sample problems? I'm gonna work in the library today with a phi kap who's a physics major.
sample 1?
Yeah or all 3 if it's not too hard
Thanks man
Hey do you happen to have an extra suitcase I can borrow?
Hey are you at home?
Just finished grading
Are you in the suite?
Yes
Can you let me in?
Yes
Are we supposed to solve the mixed hat problem for tomorrow?
I don't know
Where is it?
I don't know, I was just wondering
I have no clue either. Letâ€™s do physics HW this monday. ok?
Yeah sounds good
Hey do you remember how you did the last part of the comp methods lab?
I'm on bid meeting and can't access it now. Please remind me in an hour
Its fine, I just wanted to check before we submit
For the homework or the lab?
The lab, I'm meeting with my group now
We just finished
Sorry I couldn't be more help
No worries, have fun with the bidding
Fucking forever
How's your hand?
Not too bad, I might go to the doctor though just cause last time this happened I got a blood blister and my nail fell off
Was class important today?
Wow! Your nail fell off? That's gross and cool. Today was easy. Integral to find centr of mass
Haha yeah it was in 4th grade and I showed it to girls to gross them out
Good times
Amen. Middle school was the best
Hey do you have Sevas number?
(614) 204-3053 or (302)Â 497-3053. He has 2.
are you bidding him?
No I'm trying to find where Wes lives
Staley
Oh cool, do you know the room?
not off hand or anything
Alright thanks
Are you in the suite?
yes
Can you let me into alumni?
coming
Every time I email Chottiner it tries autocorrect to Chattier. Iâ€™m worried one day I wonâ€™t catch it
Are you at the suite?
at fribbs in one of the study rooms
No worries, I got in
cool
Hey could you send me the formula you had for the comp methods lab?
def thetaKepler2(eccenAnom, e=0.01671123):

that one?
No we need the first one, our implementation if the formula isn't working
def t(theta, e=0.01671123, tau=365.25636):


Yeah, thanks a bunch
*thats not sarcastic although it could be construed as such
youâ€™re not welcome
Did you get a straight line
?
for what?
When you graphed that equation?
that would make sense since it produces time
it is t(theta)
hopefully time runs in a straight line
Cool, thanks
no problem
good meeting?
I'm sure theyre just running late...
Or they donâ€™t love you
You got mail
To the suite?
Yeah
Cool, I might swing by to pick it up tomorrow
Whos it from?
Some rowing thing
Oh okay
Could you send me your math for the first part of the lab?
As soon as chapter ends
Sweet thanks, my phone might be dead though so message me on facebook
ok
Hey are you in the lounge?
Yes
Aight cool
Ok
Can you let me in?
yes.
How did you do on the 250 midterm?
I dunno, I got a B for the midterm grade though
What were the cutoffs I have no clue where I stand relative to others? Also how's rowing?
I dunno, I just checked my test grade though, I cut it close
Also rowing is fuckin brutal
But in a good way
Kinda
Close to A or C?
Well I got a 42% on the written and 98% on the programming
At least u get. Shit tons of free food
So a flat 70 overall
Yeah I just wish I didnt have to do all this rowing for it
Howd you do?
91% overall
Got a b on the written but an a on the computational
Nice
This is one of my top 2 favorite classes
Youre the worst
I'd put it just above probability for classes
U don't like this class? It's tough as balls but it's sooo cool.
Wow. That
Is harsh
Eh I just don't find the methods interesting. I like the problems though
And since its a class on methods that doesnt bode well for me
We are going to be doing some crazy stuff soon, or so I heard
I
It's only in the name
Well I'll try to show up for those classes
Gotta go now though for water stuff
Ok. Have fun
Me too. It
It's time for an afternoon nap
Haha have fun with that too
are you living in your house next semester?
are you living in your house next semester?
Yeah I think so
ok. never mind
Second floor sears
http://worrydream.com/MediaForThinkingTheUnthinkable/
You got mail
Can our cheat sheet be two sided?
yes
Sweet, thanks
coding for biologists


Doooooope
Yeah. I really want to give this a go. I canâ€™t wait until they release the language
Same, let me know if you see it come out
will do
:(
What happened?
I loved the Vshow
I can't tell if thats sarcasm but thanks
How the f did you do the aperture?
I essentially just made a function that was A in between the slits and 0 otherwise then plotted it
I know that. I just canâ€™t get any function I write to do that
any hints
Well first I made a function for just A(z), then I used np.where on the output to set all z outside of a certain range to 0
I did that but mine is still messed up
Is it out of phase or does it just not work
out of phase
Mine was out of phase before I changed the z0
HALLP
Haha you have to adjust the z0s so the slits are centered
Iâ€™m going to hunt you down.
Class is over!
Be free!
Iâ€™m just trying to do it so I can do nothing sunday
Gahh alright I'll help you after initiation tonight
Itâ€™s alright. I got it
Do you mind sending me your 250 notes if you have them scanned?
I do not have them scanned. If you want to study tomorrow, that'd be good
Definitely when I get back although I dont know when thatll be
Ok
Meet at Fribbs at 5?
Iâ€™m meeting with Sam then to study
I'll be back around 7 but if youre still studying I'll join yoy
*you
sure
Can you let me in?
sure
Where you at Homie
Im walkin over dawg
